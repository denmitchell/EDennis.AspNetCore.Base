1. Rework ApiLauncher 
   - Use ManifestEmbeddedFileProvider per ApiLauncherFactory
   - Do not use GetCommandLineArguments()
   - Can ApiLauncher be a singleton service?
		-- ApiLauncher is generic with type param = Startup
		-- So, if we do TryAddSingleton(this), another instance should not be added later by Startup
	    -- Have ProjectPorts as property of ApiLauncher?
		-- pass reference to parent ApiLauncher?
		-- Have ApiLauncherMiddleware that ensures that all Apis are launched before proceeding?
		-- Any harm in launching identity server multiple times?
2. Add logging to InstructionMiddleware, PreAuthenticationMiddleware, 
   ScopePropertiesMiddleware, and DbContextOptionsInterceptor (modify)
3. Rework Xunit base classes and supporting classes
	-- Need separate classes for endpoint tests
	-- May need separate classes for IRepo and ITemporalRepo
