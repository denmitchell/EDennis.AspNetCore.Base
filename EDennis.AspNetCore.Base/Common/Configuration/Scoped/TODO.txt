Middleware Pipeline
	1. PreAuthenticationMiddleware (combines AutoLogin and MockClient)
		- *** ENVIRONMENT GUARD - NEVER IN PRODUCTION
		- Checks for SPI header 
			-- if present 
				--- creates ActiveProfile based upon SPI header
			-- else
				--- creates ActiveProfile based upon ...
					---- LaunchProfile, if present
					---- Default, otherwise
		- Based upon PreAuthenticationMiddleware Options either ...
			-- Adds a MockClient with requested scope for the current application,
		       as well as a special 'spi:{SPI}' scope
			   OR
			-- Adds an AutoLogin ClaimsPrincipal with designated claims
	2. AuthenticationMiddleware
	3. AuthorizationMiddleware
	4. ScopePropertiesMiddleware
		- Stores the user
		- Stores claims with designated patterns
		- Stores headers with designated patterns
		- Parses and stores the ScopeProfileInstruction (SPI)
		- Creates/updates and stores the ActiveProfile
			
	5. DbConnectionMiddleware
		Replaces DbContextOptions in DbContextOptionsProvider to change databases/connections dynamically
